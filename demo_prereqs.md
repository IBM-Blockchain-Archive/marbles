Install the prereqs on your local system to allow you to run the marbles or CP-Web app locally.  If you completed the [learn chaincode](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode) demo, your environment is ready to go.  If not, then 
follow the [IBM Blockchain development setup instructions](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode/blob/v2.0/docs/setup.md) and install the following components:  
  -  Git - Needed to clone the code locally to your system.  
  -  Node.js - Needed to install and run the app locally.  
There are more components listed in the setup link, but these are all you need to run for the marbles and CP-Web demo flows.
